# BLEBeaconSmartParking-C06  

Capstone Project C06 â€” IoT-based Smart Parking System for the Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada.  
The system integrates **BLE beacons (HM-10)**, **motion sensors**, and **STM32 (Blackpill)** as the main MCU, with optional computer vision (OV2640) for slot validation. A solar-powered module supports each slot, while a **mobile app** provides real-time user authentication, slot monitoring, and violation notifications.  

## Features  
- ðŸ”¹ **BLE-based User Identification**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Slot Monitoring with Motion Sensor & BLE Trigger**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Solar-powered & Energy Efficient Modules**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Centralized Processing with STM32 Blackpill**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Mobile App Integration for Realtime Notifications**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Optional Computer Vision for Parking Alignment**  

## Tech Stack  
- **Hardware**: STM32F407VGT6 (Blackpill), HM-10 BLE, Motion Sensor, OV2640 Camera, Solar Panel + Battery  
- **Software**: Ktor (Kotlin) Backend, Flutter Mobile App, PostgreSQL Database  
- **Approach**: IoT + Computer Vision + Mobile Integration  

## Project Scope  
This project is developed as a **functional miniature prototype** for academic purposes, with potential to scale into a real-world 1:1 prototype depending on available resources.
